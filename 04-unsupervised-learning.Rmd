# Extension to unsupervised learning

This interface could also be extended to unsupervised learning following the spirit of `Scikit-Learn` by replacing the `predict` method with `transform` in the unsupervised case.

`cv_model` metalearner default grids

## Pipelines?

Could just create supervised learning steps

### Special cases

#### Non-repeatable mappings

#### Invertible Mappings

related to `recipes` but different

it would nice to have a standard (S3 method?) for invertible mappings in the spirit of scale/unscale
n some sense recipes does this, but only for the forward direction
1cale/unscale store information about the transform in the returned object, which i'm not sold on
1ut what about something like

p# TODO: implement PCA example transformation, smart IRLBA/non-IRLBA selection

supervised learning: models
unsupervised learning: ??? transformation?

clustering: cv equivalent to select number of clusters and average k-means assignments or penalty parameter for convex clustering

```{r}
pca_trans <- pca(X)
Z <- forward(pca_trans, X)
X_recovered <- backward(pca_trans, Z)
```

klearn does this with the fit/fit_transform methods but i don't think provides a standard for the inverse mapping
