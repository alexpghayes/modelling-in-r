# Fitting model families

Fitting a `model` is quite different from fitting a `model family`. To fit a model, we need:

- Data
- Specific hyperparameter values
- A way to train the model given data and specific hyperparameters

On the other hand, to fit a model family, we need:

- Data
- The hyperparameter space to consider
- A way to train the model given data and specific hyperparameters
- A way to search through hyperparameter space
- A way to determine which trained model is best

To find the best model in the model family, we need a performance metric, such as root mean squared error, and an estimate of this metric on out-of-sample model data. This likely means getting multiple estimates of model performance by fitting the same model on resampled datasets.

Keeping models and model families in mind, let's think about some features that would make a modelling interface intuitive and useful to users.
