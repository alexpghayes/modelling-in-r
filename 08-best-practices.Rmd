# Best Practices

`astsa` as an example of interactively useful but programmatically a pain

- Show your example data in the README so users immediately *see* the structure
- Model classes beyond lists

best practices: type definitions of methods for most functions


as soon as there is a recipe interface for GLMs that's all i'm ever going to use

habit: get the df right, then y ~ . in the formula. would be nice to still see the features in the call?




Every modeling function should include its package version in its data object
I will now save my models as a list of three objects: model, data, and sessioninfo::session_info()


Should be easy to get the values plotted so others can make their own plots


modelling packages:
 - vignette should include not only the coefficients as output in an example, but also those coefficients written up as a general latex model and as a latex model with those specific coefficients substituted in
 
 
 
TWO DISTINCT ISSUES THAT GET RESOLVED IN FORMULAE:

- design matrix specification
- model specification. (a la `fGarch::garchFit(~arma(1, 1) + garch(1, 0)))`

where is the appropriate space in my framework to specify the arma and garch parameters? i.e. we specify these as models rather than model families, (although specifying one as a model family could be interesting as well)
 
 
calls to `fit` should be pure: i.e. no side effects like plotting, and especially no plotting with invisible object return
